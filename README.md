# Workout Journal Tracker
Tool built with Python and Pandas to read an Excel spreadsheet containing my workout journal since 2021. 
It is able to read multiple sheets and aggregate the amount of reps, sets and rest by exercise, workout section (pull, push, legs), workout type (reps, abs, legs), month and differentiate between bodyweight or weighted training. The data is then used to build graphs and charts using seaborn and bokeh.
